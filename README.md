English Dictionary 


Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. 
Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. 
Hence, we have used "tkinter" library to create this simple interface of the application.

Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold 
only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. 
Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.A Dictionary in Python works similar 
to the Dictionary in a real world. Keys of a Dictionary must be unique and of immutable data type such as Strings, Integers, and tuples, but 
the key-values can be repeated and be of any type.
